# WWE Earnings Analysis

Company earnings calls, no matter what industry, play a huge role in company stock price (along with current events and other relevant internal/external news around the company and industry). Here, public companies are able to share their financial performance with investors and explain any context behind the results within the firm. Within this call, analysts, investors, and company officials are able to interact with each other to understand the current situation of the company and anything positive or alarming that has happened that could affect company equity.

In this project, I was able to use sentiment analysis to assess the earnings call transcripts in terms of 3 measures: overall sentiment, valence, and presence of trustworthy words/statements. Juxtaposing this with data on stock prices within a 10-day scope helped me understand the relationship of these measures with investor/stockholder reception, and consequently, what investors find most important and drastic in assessing company value. This kind of analyses could also be applied for companies not just in the sports and entertainment industries, but in many others that rely on public companies' relationship with investors and other stockholders.
